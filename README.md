The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.

The Good: Price. Nice Bang for the $$.
nice TouchPad, better than Microsoft All-In-One Keyboard.

The bottom is plastic painted silver,
the top is true aluminium...
plastic is Not cold to the touch.
when you put the laptop in your legs is Not cold.
Aluminium top cover is cold to the touch.

The Bad: 
there are different models,
i have the i3 "the cheap",
i3 does Not seem to have HW acceleration for video playback.
that means has 50% CPU load when playing a YT video.
means your legs get hot, and plastic does Not dissipate heat as good as aluminium.
eats more energy doing the same thing.
No HW h264 video aceleration/decoding is BAD.

avoid i3 model, 
its hard because the price.
go for i5 if you can.

has the cheapest Kingston M.2 256GB NVMe,
has 4GB of RAM, Kingston,
has 4GB of slower ram, Samsung, soldered to the mobo.

thats why is cheap.

The screen is FullHD 1920x1080 15.x" very nice, for a cheap machine the screen is nice.
there is always the dilema, to buy a smaller oled HQ screen, or a big lower quality but acceptable Quality.
Big screen, closer makes you feel inmersed more in the OS.
Purchasing HD screen 1300x768 today is absurd.

has silver looks with black keys, very similar to Apple MacBookPro from 2013,
but keys does Not feel as good quality as Apple.
dilema: buy used Apple or New acer.

Apple has a software called MacsFanControl, works in Windows and Mac,
allows to fine tune fan speed manually.
If it had a Linux version, purchasing old Apple would be more interesting.

has intel RST with Optane,
Optane is a blade that cuts both ways,
Optane Raid tech, allos to extend the life of the main drive by using the smaller more, avoiding wear to the main drive,
a cheap QLC can last as long as TLC, and Optane+TLC last as long has 2-Bit MLC.

also increase speed when combined with a small HDD, SS, because Optane is faster M.2.
That Tech i think it was invented by Apple in 2014 called Fusion Drive.
MacMini 2014 with Fusion Drive had a 800MB/s 128GB PCIe drive + Slow 1TB 5400rpm drive.

The Ugly:
if you dont know how to disable Optane in the Bios, you cant install other OS.
Not Windows8.1, Not Linux.
intel Only makes Optane drivers for W10.

Laptop runs ok without Optane, runs fast, because its M.2 NVMe.
cheap NVMe or SSD require system image backup every year.
Cloning Linux is very easy with Clonezilla, or even with Gparted.
Windows is very complicated because the Activation Key License Security.

comes with W10 RTM OEM CoreSingleLanguage.
thats the key stored in the UEFI of the machine.
if you want another language, you need to download a new OEM installer "complicated."
Windows makes simple thing complicated.
Linux works Ok Kernel5 has all the drivers, except Optane.
Works Ok.

i wish keys were a bit better quality like Mac,
everything works ok but... i regret purchasing i3, i wish i had the i5.
i3 never again. leason lerned.
in a cold place the i3 would be nice, it generates more heat.
